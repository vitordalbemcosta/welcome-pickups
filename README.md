## 💻 Project

Welcome to the welcome_test project! This project is a Gatsby-based web application created by Vitor Dalbem Costa

This project displays a scheduled transfers feed page. The data is coming from transfers_details.json & transfers_list.json rather than an API;

The user is able to check the next scheduled transfers on this app. In a grid separated by days;

The user has the option of clicking on one of the in order to open a modal with more information about that specific transfer chosen;

This is a responsive-fliendly project, therefore, the scheduled transfers & modal will have its own style when the screen reaches a certain px;
